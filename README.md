# Netflix Dataset Analysis

## Project Overview

This project performs an in-depth analysis of a Netflix dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and insights about content availability, release trends, and other key metrics. The analysis was carried out using Python, with libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib` for data processing and visualization.

## Objectives

- Analyze the dataset to understand content distribution by genre, release date, and ratings.
- Visualize trends in Netflix's content library over the years.
- Provide actionable insights into the types of content that dominate the platform.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about Netflix's library, including:
- Titles of movies and TV shows
- Release dates
- Genres and categories
- Ratings

The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize date formats, and remove duplicate entries.

## Tools and Libraries

The analysis was conducted using the following tools:
- **Python**: The programming language used for the analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For running and documenting the code.
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis.
  - `numpy`: Numerical computations.
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn`: Data visualization.
  - `datetime`: Handling date and time formats.

## Key Findings

1. **Content Trends**:
   - Most content on Netflix falls under specific genres such as Drama, Comedy, and Documentary.
   - A significant rise in Netflix Original content was observed after 2015.

2. **Release Patterns**:
   - The majority of content is released during specific months, likely targeting peak viewing periods.

3. **Rating Distribution**:
   - An analysis of content ratings reveals patterns based on target audience age groups.

4. **Top Content Producers**:
   - Insights into countries contributing the most content to Netflix.

## Visualizations

The project includes visualizations to illustrate:
- The distribution of content by genre.
- Yearly trends in new content releases.
- Rating distribution for movies and TV shows.
